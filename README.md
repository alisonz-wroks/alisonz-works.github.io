I am a computational storyteller and filmmaker exploring how people find identity, imeaning, and home in systems they cannot change.
This site documents my work in interactive games, documentary film, and experimental narrative systems — from a story-driven visual novel on Steam to data-informed documentary projects about place, memory, and identity.
