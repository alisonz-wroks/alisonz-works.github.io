        <h2>Creative Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          I created <em>Death That Blooms Into a Flower</em> after becoming deeply interested in how people make meaning when faced with death, religion, and emotional loss.
          The story is inspired by philosophical and theological questions about love, sacrifice, and human dignity, especially in situations where suffering feels unavoidable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than telling a linear story, I wanted players to actively participate in the characters’ emotional journeys, allowing their choices to shape how grief, faith, and intimacy are expressed.

          <p>
            I began with a high-level narrative outline focused on emotional arcs rather than plot events.  
            Each chapter was designed around a specific emotional state: hope, doubt, despair, and reconciliation.

            After releasing early builds and the Steam wishlist page, I collected player responses from social media and testers.
            Many players commented on the emotional weight of the story and the impact of their choices.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adjusted dialogue pacing based on player confusion</li>
            <li>Refined emotional transitions between scenes</li>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            To move beyond fixed dialogue trees, I designed a system that tracks players’ choices as emotional variables.
            These variables influence how characters speak, react, and interpret events.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each choice modifies emotional states such as grief, trust, and detachment</li>
            <li>Dialogue lines are selected based on the current emotional profile</li>
            <li>The narrative becomes a dynamic response to player behavior</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This model allows the game to simulate how real people express themselves differently under emotional pressure, making the story more psychologically realistic.
